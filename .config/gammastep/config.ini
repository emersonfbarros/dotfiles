; 1 will gradually apply the new screen temperature over a couple of seconds.
fade=1

; Custom dawn/dusk intervals.
; Instead of using the solar elevation, the time intervals of dawn and dusk
; can be specified manually. The times must be specified as HH:MM in 24-hour
; format.
dawn-time=5:20-5:40
dusk-time=17:46-18:06

; Set the screen gamma (for all colors, or each color channel
; individually)
gamma=0.8
;gamma=0.8:0.7:0.8
; This can also be set individually for day and night since
; version 1.10.
;gamma-day=0.8:0.7:0.8
;gamma-night=0.6

; Set the adjustment-method: 'randr', 'vidmode', 'drm', 'wayland'.
; 'randr' is the preferred X11 method, 'vidmode' is an older API
; that works in some cases when 'randr' does not.
; The adjustment method settings are in a different section.
adjustment-method=wayland

; Configuration of the adjustment-method
; type 'gammastep -m METHOD:help' to see the settings.
; ex: 'gammastep -m randr:help'
; In this example, randr is configured to adjust only screen 0.
; Note that the numbering starts from 0, so this is actually the first screen.
; If this option is not specified, Redshift will try to adjust _all_ screens.
